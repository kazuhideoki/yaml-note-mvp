# Sample Note with Absolute Schema Path

## Introduction
This note uses an absolute path to reference its schema, which is no longer supported.

## Expected Behavior
- The application should show an error message
- The error should indicate that absolute paths are not supported
- The error should suggest using a relative path instead
